## Mezo Documentation

Developer documentation site for the Mezo ecosystem. This repo contains the source for the public docs at `https://mezo.org/docs`, built with Astro and Starlight.

### Tech stack
- **Astro 5** with **Starlight** for documentation
- **Node.js** and **npm** for scripts and tooling
- **remark-math** and **rehype-katex** for math/KaTeX support
- **sharp** for image processing
- **starlight-sidebar-topics** to manage sidebar topics

### Contributing
We welcome issues and PRs that improve clarity, correctness, and coverage.

1) Fork and branch
- Create a descriptive branch from `main`:
  - `docs/<topic>-<short-description>` (documentation changes)
  - `fix/<scope>-<short-description>` (bugfixes in scripts/config)
  - `chore/<short-description>` (non-user-facing maintenance)

2) Style and formatting
- Use **Prettier** via:
```bash
npm run lint-fix
```
- Keep markdown concise, use headings (`##`, `###`) and lists, and prefer site-relative links.

3) Commit messages
- Follow Conventional Commits when possible:
  - `docs: update mezo-pools user guide`
  - `fix(scripts): handle missing asset directory in process step`

4) Run locally and sanity-check
- `npm run dev` then review pages you modified at `http://localhost:4321`.
- Optional: with the dev server running, check links:
```bash
npm run linkcheck-local
```

5) Open a pull request
- Keep PRs focused and small; include context, screenshots if UI/content heavy, and links to related issues.
- The docs site deploy pipeline will build the site; ensure the dev build works before requesting review.

6) Reviews & merging
- We require at least one approval from a maintainer.
- Squash-merge preferred; branch names and PR titles should clearly describe the change.
  
### Project structure
- `src/content/docs/docs/` — primary markdown content organized by topic (e.g., `users/`, `developers/`).
- `public/docs/` — static assets (images, PDFs) served as-is.
- `src/assets/` — project assets referenced by the site.
- `scripts/process-gitbook.js` — parses `SUMMARY.md`, transforms GitBook-style content, and updates sidebar topics in `astro.config.mjs`.
- `scripts/linkcheck.js` — simple crawler to check links when the site is running locally.
- `astro.config.mjs` — Astro/Starlight configuration and custom head scripts.

Tips:
- Add or update docs under `src/content/docs/docs/…`.
- Place large assets in `public/docs/...` and reference via site-relative paths.
- Run `npm run dev` to auto-process and preview changes.
