# How to Redeem MUSD on Mezo

## Quick Overview
Redeeming lets you burn 1 MUSD to recieve $1 in BTC (minus a 0.75% redemption fee and gas fees). The system redeems from the trove with the lowest collateral ratio first.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, verify:

1. **System is accepting redemptions**: Go to TroveManager → "Read as Proxy" → call `getTCR()` with current BTC price. Must show ≥ `1100000000000000000` (110%)
2. **You have MUSD**: Check your balance on the MUSD token contract
3. **Get current BTC price**: Go to PriceFeed → "Read as Proxy" → call `fetchPrice()`
4. **Get correct contract addresses**: See contract addresses at the bottom for both Mainnet and Testnet.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to TroveManager Contract
Open the TroveManager contract in your block explorer and click the **"Write as Proxy"** tab.

### 2. Find Function 11: `redeemCollateral`

You'll see 6 input fields. Here's how to fill them:

## Option A: Quick & Simple (Higher Gas)

Use this if you want to redeem quickly without calculating hints.

- `_amount`: [your amount in wei - see conversion below]   
- `_firstRedemptionHint`: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000   
- `_upperPartialRedemptionHint`: [your wallet address]   
- `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint`: [your wallet address]   
- `_partialRedemptionHintNICR`: 1100000000000000000000   
- `_maxIterations`: 10

**Converting MUSD to Wei:**
- 100 MUSD = `100000000000000000000`
- 5,005 MUSD = `5005000000000000000000`

**Formula**: Your amount × 1000000000000000000

## Option B: With Hints (Lower Gas)

Use this to save on gas costs.

### Step 1: Get Redemption Hints

Go to HintHelpers → "Read as Proxy" → `getRedemptionHints()`

Fill in:
- `_amount`: Your amount in wei (same as above)
- `_price`: Current BTC price from PriceFeed
- `_maxIterations`: 50

Copy the returned values:
- `firstRedemptionHint`
- `partialRedemptionHintNICR`

### Step 2: Get Position Hints

Go to SortedTroves → "Read as Proxy" → `findInsertPosition()`

Fill in:
- `_NICR`: Use the `partialRedemptionHintNICR` from Step 1
- `_prevId`: Your wallet address
- `_nextId`: Your wallet address

Copy the returned values:
- `upperHint`
- `lowerHint`

### Step 3: Call redeemCollateral

Go back to TroveManager → "Write as Proxy" → `redeemCollateral`

- `_amount`: [your amount in wei]
- `_firstRedemptionHint`: [from Step 1]
- `_upperPartialRedemptionHint`: [upperHint from Step 2]
- `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint`: [lowerHint from Step 2]
- `_partialRedemptionHintNICR`: [from Step 1]
- `_maxIterations`: 50

## What You'll Receive

**Example: Redeeming 100 MUSD**
- You burn: 100 MUSD
- You receive: $99.25 worth of BTC (0.75% fee goes to protocol)

**Formula**: (Your MUSD Amount ÷ BTC Price) × 0.9925 = BTC received

---

## Common Issues

**"Cannot redeem when TCR < MCR"**
→ System TCR is below 110%. Wait until it recovers.

**"Unable to redeem any amount"**
→ No troves available with collateral ratio above 110%.

**Transaction runs out of gas**
→ Lower `_maxIterations` to 10 or split into smaller redemptions.

**Transaction reverts unexpectedly**
→ Get fresh hints and try again. Someone may have redeemed before you.

**Received less than expected**
→ Check the `Redemption` event in your transaction. Some MUSD may have been returned if the last trove would go below 1,800 MUSD minimum.

## Tips

- **Generate hints immediately before redeeming** - They become stale if someone else redeems first
- **Use Option A for small amounts** (< $10,000) - The higher gas cost is negligible
- **Use Option B for large amounts** - Saves significant gas on big redemptions
- **Set higher maxIterations for larger redemptions**:
  - Small (< 10 troves): 10
  - Medium (10-30 troves): 50
  - Large (30+ troves): 100
