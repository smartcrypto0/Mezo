## FAQs

**Can I unlock my BTC early?**

No. Locks are permanent until expiration. Choose your duration carefully.

**What happens if I don't vote?**

You won't earn any fees or mats emissions from gauges. However, you'll still receive bridging fees distributed to all veBTC holders.

**Can I have multiple veBTC positions?**

Yes. Each lock creates a separate veBTC NFT. You can merge them later if desired.

**Can I use my locked BTC as collateral?**

No. Your veBTC NFT cannot be used as collateral in Mezo's MUSD borrowing system without unlocking the underlying BTC.
