Locking BTC gives you a veBTC NFT, which grants voting power, protocol fees, and governance rights. See the [veBTC Overview](/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vebtc) for details on what you earn.

## Prerequisites

Before locking BTC, ensure you have:

- BTC deposited on Mezo
- A connected wallet
- Sufficient BTC for gas fees

See the [Getting Started](/docs/users/getting-started/deposit-assets) section for guidance.

## Navigate to Lock

<Steps>
1. Open the Mezo app

3. You'll see your eligible assets
</Steps>

## Initiate Lock

Find the BTC asset card showing your available balance and click **Lock**. A lock configuration modal appears where you'll configure your position.

**Amount:** Enter the amount of BTC you want to lock. You can lock any amount up to your available balance.

**Duration:** Select your lock duration from 1 to 28 days. Longer locks maintain higher voting power for longer periods. The interface shows your estimated initial veBTC voting power, which represents your weight at the start of the lock.

> **Note:** Lock durations are aligned to epoch boundaries and rounded down to the nearest full week. A max lock created mid-epoch will result in an effective duration of 21–28 days. See [Epochs](/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vebtc#epochs) for details.

## Confirm Transaction

Review your lock details:

- BTC amount
- Lock duration
- Initial veBTC weight
- Lock expiration date

Click **Confirm Lock**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for blockchain confirmation.

## View Your Position

After confirmation, view your lock details under the Lock page, including:

- Current voting power (decays over time)
- Lock expiration date
- Options to extend your lock
