## FAQs

### Can I unlock my MEZO early?

No. Locks are permanent until expiration. Choose your duration carefully—veMEZO locks can be up to 4 years.

### Can I vote on gauges with only veMEZO?

No. veMEZO does not grant independent voting power. You need veBTC to vote on staking gauges, validator gauges, or ecosystem gauges. veMEZO only multiplies veBTC voting power.

### What can I do with veMEZO if I don't have veBTC?

You can still:

- Earn rebase rewards from weekly emissions
- Vote on other users' veBTC boost gauges to earn incentives they post

### How do I boost my veBTC position?

You can either:

1. Lock your own MEZO as veMEZO and vote on your veBTC gauge
2. Post incentives on your veBTC gauge to attract veMEZO votes from others

See [Boost Mechanism](/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vemezo/boost-mechanism) for details.

### Can I have multiple veMEZO positions?

Yes. Each lock creates a separate veMEZO NFT. You can merge them later if desired.

### Can I transfer my veMEZO?

Yes. veMEZO positions are ERC-721 NFTs and can be transferred. However, veMEZO NFTs created through productive vesting (grants) cannot be merged with other NFTs while the grant remains revocable.

### What happens to my veMEZO if I don't vote?

You still earn rebase rewards. However, you won't earn any incentives from veBTC boost gauges unless you allocate your veMEZO weight.

### Why is my boost lower than expected?

The boost formula depends on your relative share of total veBTC and total veMEZO. If total locked amounts increase (across all users of Mezo), your share decreases, and so does your boost—even if your absolute holdings haven't changed.
