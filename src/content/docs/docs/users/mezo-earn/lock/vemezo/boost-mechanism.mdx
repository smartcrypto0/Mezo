veMEZO boosts your veBTC voting power by up to 5x. This page explains how the boost formula works and how the matching market pairs veBTC and veMEZO holders.

## How Boost Works

Your boosted voting weight combines your veBTC with any veMEZO allocated to your position:

**Boosted Weight = |veBTC| × min(5, 1 + Boost)**

Where the Boost term is:

**Boost = 4 × (|veBTC|_total / |veBTC|) × (|veMEZO| / |veMEZO|_total)**

### Key Properties

- **Minimum multiplier: 1x** — A veBTC position with no veMEZO votes operates at base weight
- **Maximum multiplier: 5x** — No combination of holdings can exceed 5x
- **Relative, not absolute** — Your boost depends on your share of total veBTC and total veMEZO, not raw amounts

## Understanding the Formula

The boost formula has important implications:

**Larger veBTC positions need more veMEZO.** The formula contains |veBTC|_total / |veBTC| in the numerator. As your veBTC share grows, this ratio shrinks, requiring proportionally more veMEZO to maintain the same boost level.

**You reach max boost when your shares match.** A participant hits the 5x cap when their share of veMEZO equals or exceeds their share of veBTC:

**|veMEZO| / |veMEZO|_total ≥ |veBTC| / |veBTC|_total**

:::note[Example]
If you hold 1% of all veBTC, you need at least 1% of all veMEZO to reach the maximum 5x multiplier.

## The Matching Market

Every veBTC NFT has its own veBTC boost gauge. veMEZO holders vote on these gauges to allocate boost.

### How It Works

1. **veBTC holder creates a position** — A veBTC NFT is minted with an associated boost gauge
2. **veMEZO holders vote** — They allocate veMEZO weight to veBTC gauges
3. **Boost is calculated** — The veBTC position's boost depends on total veMEZO votes it receives
4. **Position is "poked"** — The veBTC holder triggers a transaction to apply the new boost

### Why This Creates a Market

**BTC-heavy users** can attract boost by posting incentives on their veBTC gauge. If the incentive yield per unit of veMEZO is attractive, veMEZO holders will vote for that gauge.

**MEZO-heavy users** earn by voting on well-incentivized veBTC gauges, even if they hold little BTC themselves.

The matching market prices boost as a permissionless, tradable service.

## Boost Without Holding MEZO

You don't need to hold MEZO yourself to benefit from boost. If you post attractive incentives on your veBTC gauge, other veMEZO holders may vote for it—giving your position a multiplier without you locking any MEZO.

Conversely, a veBTC position with no veMEZO votes still:

- Retains full base voting weight (1x multiplier)
- Earns passive bridging fees
- Can vote on gauges to earn fees and emissions

Boost enhances returns but isn't required to participate.

## Summary

| Scenario | Multiplier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| veBTC only, no veMEZO votes | 1x | Base weight, still earns fees |
| veBTC + some veMEZO votes | 1x–5x | Multiplier scales with veMEZO share |
| veBTC + proportional veMEZO share | 5x | Maximum boost achieved |
| veMEZO only, no veBTC | — | Cannot vote on gauges; earns rebases only |
