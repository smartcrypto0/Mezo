The Matching Market is how veBTC and veMEZO get paired together. It allows BTC holders to access boost without holding MEZO, and MEZO holders to earn yield without holding significant BTC.

## The Problem It Solves

Mezo's dual-token system requires both veBTC and veMEZO to maximize voting power. But not everyone holds both:

- **BTC-heavy users** want the 5x boost but may not have MEZO
- **MEZO-heavy users** have veMEZO but limited BTC to vote with

The Matching Market connects these two sides.

## How It Works

Every veBTC position has its own boost gauge. This gauge doesn't distribute emissions—it determines how much veMEZO boost that veBTC position receives.

### The Flow

1. **veBTC holder locks BTC** → Receives a veBTC NFT with an associated boost gauge
2. **veBTC holder posts incentives** → Deposits tokens (any ERC-20) to their boost gauge to attract veMEZO votes
3. **veMEZO holders vote** → Allocate veMEZO weight to attractive boost gauges
4. **Boost is applied** → The veBTC position's multiplier increases based on veMEZO votes received
5. **Incentives are claimed** → veMEZO voters claim their share of incentives at epoch end

## Two Sides of the Market

### If You're BTC-Heavy

You want boost but don't have enough MEZO. Your options:

- Post incentives on your veBTC gauge to attract veMEZO votes
- Pay for boost rather than locking MEZO yourself
- The market determines the going rate for boost

### If You're MEZO-Heavy

You have veMEZO but limited BTC. Your options:

- Vote on well-incentivized veBTC gauges to earn yield
- Provide boost as a service to BTC holders willing to pay
- Earn returns on your MEZO without needing significant BTC exposure

---

## Why This Matters

The Matching Market turns boost into a priced, tradable service:

- **Boost has a market rate** determined by supply and demand
- **Users don't need to hold both tokens** to benefit from the system
- **Capital efficiency improves** — BTC holders focus on BTC, MEZO holders focus on MEZO

Without the Matching Market, users would need to hold proportional amounts of both tokens to participate effectively. The market removes that friction.

## Risks

As a community-built tool, the Matching Market carries additional risks:

- **Smart contract risk** — Contracts may not have been audited to the same standard as core Mezo protocol
- **No official support** — Mezo cannot provide support or assistance for issues with the Matching Market
- **Operational risk** — The tool may be modified, discontinued, or experience downtime without notice
