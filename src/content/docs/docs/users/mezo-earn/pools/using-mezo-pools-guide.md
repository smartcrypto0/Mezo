# Staking LP tokens

Once you've provided liquidity to a pool and received LP tokens, you can stake them to earn additional rewards.

## How to Stake LP Tokens

1. Navigate to the [Pools page on Mezo Explore](https://mezo.org/explore/pools)
2. Select your position
3. Click "Stake" on your LP tokens
4. Confirm the transaction

Once staking is live, staking your LP tokens will allow you to start earning additional rewards including emissions and more!
