## Understanding Voting Power

When you lock BTC, your voting power is tokenized as an NFT. This NFT represents your governance weight and entitles you to:

- A proportional share of trading fees generated by the gauges you vote for
- A proportional share of incentives deposited for those gauges
- The ability to vote on where new mats emissions are directed

**Decay Mechanics:** Your voting power decays linearly over time. If you lock 1 BTC for 28 days, your weight starts at 1.0 but decreases continuously until it reaches zero at expiration. You can extend your lock at any time to maintain maximum influence.

## Earning as a Voter

You earn from two sources when you vote on a gauge:

### Trading Fees

- **Source:** 100% of the trading fees generated by the specific pool you voted for
- **Distribution:** You receive a proportional share based on your voting weight. If a pool generates $10,000 in fees and you provided 5% of the votes on that gauge, you earn $500.
- **Claimable:** Paid out in the tokens of the pool (e.g., BTC and MUSD)

### Incentives

- **Source:** External incentives deposited by protocols to attract votes to their gauges
- **Distribution:** Like fees, incentives are split proportionally among all voters on that gauge
- **Claimable:** Paid out in the token deposited by the protocol

This creates a market cycle: You direct mats emissions to pools, creating deeper liquidity. Deeper liquidity attracts volume and fees. You then capture your share of those fees.

## Managing Your Position

### The Weekly Epoch

Mezo operates in 7-day epochs starting Thursday at 00:00 UTC. Votes do not persist — you must return every epoch to re-cast your vote. If you do not vote in a given week, you forfeit your share of fees and incentives for that period.

### Claiming Rewards

Fees and incentives accrue to your veBTC position as the epoch progresses. However, they only become claimable once the epoch ends.

1. Navigate to your dashboard
2. Click **Claim All**
3. Your earned fees and incentives are sent to your wallet

### Extending Locks

To maintain your influence on rewards distribution, monitor your lock duration. As your lock decays, your voting power diminishes.

Select **Extend Lock** on your NFT to restore full weight. See [Managing Locks and Collecting Rewards](/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vebtc/managing-locks-and-collecting-rewards) for more information.
