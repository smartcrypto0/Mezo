## Understanding Voting Power

When you lock BTC, your voting power is tokenized as an NFT. This NFT represents your governance weight and entitles you to:

- A proportional share of trading fees generated by the gauges you vote for
- A proportional share of incentives deposited for those gauges
- The ability to vote on where new mats emissions are directed

**Decay Mechanics:** Your voting power decays linearly over time. If you lock 1 BTC for 28 days, your weight starts at 1.0 but decreases continuously until it reaches zero at expiration. You can extend your lock at any time to maintain maximum influence.

## Earning as a Voter

You earn from two sources when you vote on a gauge:

### Trading Fees

- **Source:** 100% of the trading fees generated by the specific pool you voted for
- **Distribution:** You receive a proportional share based on your voting weight. If a pool generates $10,000 in fees and you provided 5% of the votes on that gauge, you earn $500.
- **Claimable:** Paid out in the tokens of the pool (e.g., BTC and MUSD)

### Incentives

- **Source:** External incentives deposited by protocols to attract votes to their gauges
- **Distribution:** Like fees, incentives are split proportionally among all voters on that gauge
- **Claimable:** Paid out in the token deposited by the protocol

This creates a market cycle: You direct mats emissions to pools, creating deeper liquidity. Deeper liquidity attracts volume and fees. You then capture your share of those fees.

## Managing Your Position

### The Weekly Epoch

Mezo operates in 7-day epochs starting Thursday at 00:00 UTC. Votes do not persist — you must return every epoch to re-cast your vote. If you do not vote in a given week, you forfeit your share of fees and incentives for that period.

### Claiming Rewards

Fees and incentives accrue to your veBTC position as the epoch progresses. However, they only become claimable once the epoch ends.

1. Navigate to your dashboard
2. Click **Claim All**
3. Your earned fees and incentives are sent to your wallet

### Extending Locks

To maintain your influence on rewards distribution, monitor your lock duration. As your lock decays, your voting power diminishes.

Select **Extend Lock** on your NFT to restore full weight. See [Managing Locks and Collecting Rewards](/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vebtc/managing-locks-and-collecting-rewards) for more information.

### Poke Vote

**Poke** refreshes your lock's voting power to reflect its current state. If you've already voted in the current epoch, your votes won't automatically update when your voting power changes. Poking ensures your votes are counted with your latest voting power.

**When does voting power change?**

- Adding more BTC to your lock
- Extending your lock duration
- Claiming veMEZO rebase distributions (updates your veBTC boost)
- Receiving more veMEZO votes pointed at your veBTC position
- Natural decay as your lock approaches expiration

**When should you poke?**

As a user, you typically only need to poke after increasing your BTC lock amount, extending your lock duration, or when your veMEZO situation changes. Permanently locked positions maintain stable voting power and don't require poking unless veMEZO-related changes occur.

**Note:** Poke is permissionless — anyone can poke any lock. Others may poke your lock if your voting power has decayed to reduce its impact on vote outcomes.
