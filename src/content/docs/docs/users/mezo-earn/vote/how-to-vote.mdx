Voting allows you to direct the flow of emissions and, in return, earn a proportional share of the trading fees and incentives from the gauges you allocate to. This guide walks you through the complete process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A compatible wallet connected to Mezo (MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect-supported wallets)
- An active veBTC position (to vote on staking/validator/ecosystem gauges)
- OR an active veMEZO position (to vote on veBTC boost gauges)
- Sufficient BTC for gas fees

See [How to Lock BTC](/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vebtc/how-to-lock-btc) if you don't have a veBTC lock already.

See [How to Lock MEZO](/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vemezo/how-to-lock-mezo) if you want to create a veMEZO position.

## Voting with veBTC

veBTC holders vote on staking gauges, validator gauges, and ecosystem gauges to direct emissions and earn fees.

### Cast Your Vote

To earn rewards, you must actively allocate your voting power to specific gauges every epoch (7 days).

<Steps>
1. Visit the **Vote** tab to view your active veBTC positions. Click **Allocate** next to the veBTC position you want to vote with.

2. For the gauges you want to support, enter the percentage of your voting power you want to allocate to each. For example, you might allocate 50% to the BTC/MUSD pool, 30% to the MUSD/mUSDC pool, and 20% to the mcbBTC/BTC pool.

3. Review your allocation, and when you're ready, click **Submit Votes** in the right sidebar. Sign the transaction, and once complete, your vote is registered for the current epoch.
</Steps>

:::note[Remember]
Votes don't carry over between epochs. You must vote each week to continue earning fees and incentives.

## Voting with veMEZO

veMEZO holders vote on veBTC boost gauges to provide boost to BTC positions in exchange for incentives.

### Vote on Boost Gauges

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Boost Gauges** section to see all available veBTC positions seeking boost.

2. Review each gauge to see:
   - Current incentives posted
   - Amount of veMEZO already directed to that gauge
   - Estimated yield based on your veMEZO allocation

3. Enter the percentage of your veMEZO voting power you want to direct to each boost gauge.

4. Click **Submit Votes** and sign the transaction.
</Steps>

### What You Earn

When you direct veMEZO votes to a boost gauge:

- You earn a share of any incentives posted on that gauge, proportional to your share of veMEZO votes
- The veBTC holder receives boost, increasing their effective voting power

Note: veMEZO voters do **not** receive trading fees, MUSD revenue, or bridging fees from the veBTC positions they boost. Those rewards go to the veBTC holder. veMEZO voters only earn the incentives explicitly posted on boost gauges.

## Maximizing Your Boost (For veBTC Holders)

If you hold both veBTC and veMEZO, you can maximize your voting power:

### Option 1: Self-Boost

Direct your veMEZO votes to your own veBTC position's boost gauge.

<Steps>
1. Go to your veBTC position's boost gauge
2. Allocate your veMEZO voting power to it
3. Click **Submit Votes**
4. **Poke** your veBTC position to activate the new boost
</Steps>

### Option 2: Attract External Boost

Post incentives on your veBTC boost gauge to attract veMEZO votes from other users.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your veBTC position's boost gauge
2. Click **Add Incentives**
3. Deposit tokens (any ERC-20) as incentives
4. veMEZO holders will see your incentives and may direct votes your way
5. **Poke** your position after receiving new veMEZO votes
</Steps>

## Important: Poke After Changes

When your veMEZO situation changes, the boost doesn't automatically update. You need to **poke** your veBTC position to refresh its boosted weight.

**Poke when:**
- You receive new veMEZO votes on your boost gauge
- You direct your own veMEZO to your position
- You claim veMEZO rebase distributions
- You extend your veMEZO lock

**How to poke:**
1. Go to your veBTC position
2. Click **Poke**
3. Sign the transaction

Your new boosted weight will apply immediately.
