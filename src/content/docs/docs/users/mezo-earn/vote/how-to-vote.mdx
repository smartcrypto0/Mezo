Voting allows you to direct the flow of emissions and, in return, earn a proportional share of the trading fees and incentives from the gauges you allocate to. This guide walks you through the complete process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A compatible wallet connected to Mezo (MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect-supported wallets)
- An active veBTC position
- Sufficient BTC for gas fees

See [How to Lock BTC](/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vebtc/how-to-lock-btc) if you don't have a lock already.

## Cast Your Vote

To earn rewards, you must actively allocate your voting power to specific gauges every epoch (7 days).

<Steps>
1. Visit the **Vote** tab to view your active veBTC positions. Click **Allocate** next to the veBTC position you want to vote with.

2. For the gauges you want to support, enter the percentage of your voting power you want to allocate to each. For example, you might allocate 50% to the BTC/MUSD pool, 30% to the MUSD/mUSDC pool, and 20% to the mcbBTC/BTC pool.

3. Review your allocation, and when you're ready, click **Submit Votes** in the right sidebar. Sign the transaction, and once complete, your vote is registered for the current epoch.
</Steps>

> **Remember:** Votes don't carry over between epochs. You must vote each week to continue earning fees and incentives.
