## Leaderboard

The leaderboard ranks all users by total mats earned. View your personal rank, compare against other users, and track network-wide statistics.

Click [**View Leaderboard**](https://mezo.org/leaderboard) in the Rewards Hub to see current rankings.

## APR Boosts

Providing liquidity and depositing in vaults earns APR boosts from mats emissions. These boosts are displayed in the Rewards Hub and update dynamically based on protocol parameters.

Boost percentages vary by pool and vault based on:
* Total mats emissions allocated
* Current TVL in the pool or vault

## Common Questions

**Do rewards automatically appear in my wallet?**  
No. Rewards must be manually claimed through the Rewards Hub.

**What happens if I remove liquidity before claiming pool rewards?**  
Accrued rewards remain claimable even after removing liquidity, but pool rewards still expire after 7 days.

**Can I claim partial rewards?**  
You can claim partial rewards for pools. From the rewards hub, click "View Position" to navigate to the specific pool(s) that you have deposited to. From that page, you are able to claim those specific rewards. If you click the "Claim all/Claim remaining" button at the top of the rewards hub, it will claim mats for all of your pools positions.

**Why can't I see any rewards?**  
Confirm your wallet has participated in eligible activities and that assets are currently deposited or positions are active.

**Do I need to claim every day?**  
No. Vault rewards never expire, so claim on your own schedule. Pool rewards require claiming at least once per 7-day epoch.

**What determines my leaderboard rank?**  
Total mats earned across all activities on Mezo.
