# What Are mats?

mats are Mezo's native rewards points. Every verified incentivized action on Mezo — bridging assets, minting MUSD, swapping, providing liquidity, depositing in vaults — earns you mats.

mats align incentives across the entire Mezo ecosystem and beyond, rewarding real on-chain activity while ensuring transparent tracking of user contributions. As Mezo evolves into a feature-complete DeFi ecosystem, mats will be a core driver of protocol incentives and governance power.

## How to Earn mats

The following actions will earn you mats, which can be claimed today via the Rewards Hub in the Mezo app. Head to mezo.org/rewards to track your earnings and claim them every week.

### **Vault Deposits**
Deposit assets into Mezo Vaults (BTC Vault, MUSD Vault) to earn mats based on deposit size and duration.

### **Providing Liquidity to Mezo Pools**
