# What Are mats?

mats are Mezo's native rewards points. Every verified incentivized action on Mezo — bridging assets, minting MUSD, swapping, providing liquidity, depositing in vaults — earns you mats.

mats align incentives across the entire Mezo ecosystem and beyond, rewarding real on-chain activity while ensuring transparent tracking of user contributions. You earn them like you earn loyalty points. Think of mats as Bitcoin-friendly rewards points. 

## How to Earn mats

The following actions will earn you mats, which can be claimed today via the Rewards Hub in the Mezo app. Head to [mezo.org/rewards](https://mezo.org/rewards) to track your earnings and claim them every week. Actions labeled "Coming Soon" will be retroactively rewarded and do not currently contribute to your mats balance in your account.

- **Vault Deposits**:  
Deposit assets into the MUSD Vault to earn mats based on deposit size and duration. Rewards for more vaults coming soon.
- **Providing Liquidity to Mezo Pools**:  
Supply tokens to trading pairs on Mezo Pools to earn mats from liquidity provision.

### Coming soon

The following onchain activities may contribute to future mats rewards. These do not currently affect your mats balance.

- **Swapping on Mezo**: Swap between BTC, MUSD, USDC, USDT, and other assets on Mezo.   
- **Minting MUSD**: Open and maintain MUSD loan positions.   
- **Spending MUSD in the Mezo Market**: Use MUSD for purchases through integrated partners like Bitrefill.   

## What happened to my HODL Score and matsnet mats?

Mezo had an early depositor program that allowed users to deposit and lock BTC, tBTC, solvBTC, USDe, and other tokens for periods of 3, 6, and 9 months. For doing so, users received mats, and these balances, also known as HODL scores, were tracked on the Mezo leaderboard.

In addition to the early depositor program, matsnet (Mezo's official testnet) gave users another chance to earn mats through various onchain and community activations.

Users' mats balances from both of these campaigns are represented on the current Leaderboard, viewable in the Rewards tab of Mezo. To check your balance, head to https://mezo.org/rewards. There is currently no way to earn mats that contribute to your matsnet or early deposit totals, and your position on the old leaderboard will remain fixed.

Your current mats balance, as shown on the rewards hub, is earned from onchain activities on Mezo mainnet. Please note that certain rewards will be applied retroactively, and not all campaigns are currently displayed in the leaderboard.
