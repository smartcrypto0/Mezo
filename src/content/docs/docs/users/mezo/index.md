MEZO is Mezo's native token. It influences the direction of incentives and captures value generated by the chain.

## What is MEZO?

MEZO serves as the strategic coordination asset for the Mezo network. It doesn't replace BTC's role as pristine collateral—it amplifies and influences the direction of value that Bitcoin activity creates.

MEZO is used to:

- **Boost voting power** — Lock MEZO as veMEZO to multiply your veBTC voting weight by up to 5x
- **Earn rebase rewards** — veMEZO holders receive anti-dilution rebases from weekly emissions
