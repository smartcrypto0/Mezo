MEZO is Mezo's native token. It influences the direction of incentives, governs protocol parameters, and captures value generated by the chain.

## What is MEZO?

MEZO serves as the strategic coordination asset for the Mezo network. It doesn't replace BTC's role as pristine collateral—it amplifies and influences the direction of value that Bitcoin activity creates.

MEZO is used to:

- **Boost voting power** — Lock MEZO as veMEZO to multiply your veBTC voting weight by up to 5x
- **Earn rebase rewards** — veMEZO holders receive anti-dilution rebases from weekly emissions
- **Govern the protocol** — Shape emission allocation, splitter ratios, and protocol parameters

## MEZO vs veMEZO

|  | MEZO | veMEZO |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | Liquid, transferable token | NFT representing locked MEZO |
| How you get it | Purchase, earn, or receive via airdrop | Lock MEZO for 1 week to 4 years |
| What it does | Hold or trade | Boosts veBTC voting power, earns rebases |

## Key Properties

- **No independent voting power** — veMEZO cannot vote on gauges alone. It only multiplies veBTC weight.
- **Time-weighted** — Longer locks = higher veMEZO weight
- **Transferable as NFT** — veMEZO positions are ERC-721 NFTs that can be transferred or merged
