This walkthrough is for Lolli users who want to learn about withdrawing their sats to Mezo.

Mezo is a self-custodial Bitcoin banking platform. Users can access Bitcoin financial tools without interacting with loan officers, undergoing credit checks, or observing operational hours. 

What's launching: Withdraw sats (BTC) from Lolli directly to Mezo now. USD withdrawals as MUSD coming soon.

What this means: Your sats move from Lolli's custody to yours. You get complete ownership and access to Bitcoin-backed banking—earn yield, spend at retailers, or borrow dollars while keeping your BTC exposure.

## Before You Start: Understanding Self-Custody

Self-custody means that you control your funds when you withdraw from Lolli to Mezo. 

You own your Bitcoin completely; no one can freeze or seize your funds, and you can access them 24/7 from anywhere. However, it also means you are completely and entirely responsible for your funds. Neither Lolli nor Mezo can recover your funds if you lose access to your wallet.

### Your Seed Phrase Is Everything

When you create a wallet, you'll be given a seed phrase (also called a recovery phrase). This is typically 12 or 24 random words.

This is the master key to your Bitcoin. Anyone who has your seed phrase has complete access to your funds. If you lose it, your Bitcoin is gone forever.

**Do this:**

* Write your seed phrase on paper (or stamp it into metal)
* Store it somewhere secure—fireproof safe, safety deposit box, etc.
* Consider keeping copies in multiple secure locations
* Never take a photo of it
* Never store it digitally (no screenshots, no cloud drives, no password managers)
* Never share it with anyone, ever

**Never do this:**

* Type your seed phrase into any website or app (legitimate wallets will never ask for this)
* Store it in email, notes apps, or cloud storage
* Share it with anyone claiming to be "support" (this is always a scam)

### Protect Yourself from Scams

Real wallet providers, Lolli, and Mezo will never ask for your seed phrase. If someone asks for it, it's a scam. Period.

When in doubt, go directly to the official website by typing the URL yourself. Don't click links in emails or messages.

## Choosing Your Wallet Type

You have two options when connecting to Mezo.

### Bitcoin Wallet (Some Limitations)

**Best for:** Holding BTC, spending with Bitrefill, interacting within the Mezo ecosystem

**Limitations:** You can only withdraw BTC from Mezo back to Bitcoin addresses, and functionality can be more limited.

**Supported wallets:** Xverse, Unisat, OKX Wallet

Choose this if you mainly want to hold or spend your sats and aren't seeking more complex functionality.

### Ethereum Wallet (More Flexible, Recommended)

**Best for:** Moving beyond the Mezo ecosystem

**Advantages:** Can withdraw BTC and other tokens to Ethereum and bridge across various EVMs, full access to all Mezo features, and easier swapping between BTC and MUSD

**Recommended wallets:** MetaMask, Taho, Zerion

Choose this if you want maximum flexibility to earn, spend, and borrow on Mezo.

**Our recommendation for new users:** Start with an Ethereum wallet like Taho for the complete experience.
