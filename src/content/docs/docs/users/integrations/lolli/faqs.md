# Lolli x Mezo FAQs

## What is Mezo?

Mezo is a Bitcoin bank built by Thesis that lets you use your Bitcoin for everyday finance without ever selling it. On Mezo, Bitcoin holders can borrow money, earn yield, and spend - all powered by MUSD, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin. It's designed so you can access your Bitcoin's value while keeping your Bitcoin. Visit mezo.

## Where does Mezo operate?

Mezo is a permissionless blockchain platform, meaning it is accessible globally to anyone with a Bitcoin & EVM wallet.

## Why are 30,000 sats needed as minimum amount to withdraw to Mezo?

**Lolli → Mezo:** You can withdraw 0.0003 BTC (30,000 sats) or more from Lolli to Mezo. This minimum ensures that you can buy a Bitrefill gift card on the Mezo Market for at least $25 and have enough sats left over to cover transaction fees.

**Mezo → Bitcoin Layer 1:** Mezo currently requires a minimum of 0.01 BTC (1 million sats) to withdraw back to Bitcoin Layer 1. Until you have 1M sats in your Mezo wallet, you will not be able to withdraw to your Bitcoin L1 wallet.

We are working to reduce the minimum withdrawal amount for Mezo. 

## Do I have to connect to Mezo to use Lolli?

No, Lolli works independently. However, connecting to Mezo is recommended because it provides faster withdrawals (typically 10 seconds, replacing the old 60-90 day wait), the ability to earn yield on your sats, borrowing features where you can take loans against your BTC at 1% fixed rate, and integration with a broader Bitcoin financial ecosystem.

## Do I need a wallet to use Mezo?

Yes, you need a Bitcoin or EVM wallet to use Mezo. Supported Bitcoin wallets include Unisat, OKX, and Xverse. Supported EVM wallets include Taho, Metamask, Zerion, and OKX. You don't necessarily need to connect to Mezo to use Lolli, but you'll need an account and wallet to receive your BTC withdrawals on Mezo.

## What's the connection between Lolli and Mezo?

Lolli and Mezo are both owned by Thesis*, creating an integrated Bitcoin ecosystem. You take action on Lolli to earn sats, which you then transfer to Mezo to access finance features, allowing you to explore opportunities in the wider Bitcoin financial ecosystem. You can use Mezo's MUSD to spend or earn yield, then reinvest those earnings back into the cycle.

## How does the partnership unlock value?

The partnership provides speed through fast withdrawals that replace 60-90 day waits, flexibility with multiple withdrawal options (BTC and MUSD coming soon), growth as earned sats can start earning yield on Mezo immediately, utility where Bitcoin becomes spendable and usable instead of just stored, and ecosystem access to integrated DeFi features like borrowing, yields, and swaps.

## What is Mezo's MUSD stablecoin?

MUSD is a permissionless stablecoin 100% backed by Bitcoin reserves and designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. It is the native stablecoin on Mezo, accessible via Mezo's 'Borrow' feature or decentralized exchanges on Mezo Network.

## Can I use my MUSD for real purchases?

Yes. Through Mezo's partnership with Bitrefill, you can purchase gift cards for everyday needs. Future integrations will expand real-world use cases.

## Risk & Security

Bitcoin is held through Threshold Network's decentralized custody network, the largest decentralized Bitcoin bridge. All reserves are publicly verifiable 24/7 at tbtcscan.com. Smart contract audits have been completed. You maintain custody of your BTC—Mezo doesn't hold your keys.

## What are mats?

mats are Mezo's reward points system. You can earn mats on Mezo by interacting with the ecosystem, such as borrowing, spending MUSD at the Mezo Market, providing liquidity, and more. They have no current monetary value but unlock access to features and opportunities within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Think of mats as Bitcoin-friendly rewards points. With Lolli x Mezo partnership, alongside collecting mats on Mezo, Lolli users will be able to collect mats with their actions on Lolli. 

## How can I earn mats on Lolli?

On the web app, you can earn mats with the 3 Cups Game: It's a daily chance for you to play, have fun, and get extra rewards. mats rewards are coming to the mobile app soon! With the Lolli x Mezo partnership, you will earn mats whenever you earn sats: the daily stack and arcade.

## How can I utilize my mats on Mezo?

mats are Mezo's native rewards point. You can tip other community members, participate in games, complete community bounties, access exclusive features and leaderboards, and unlock exclusive features or financial opportunities in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Can I convert mats to sats?

No. mats and sats serve different purposes. Sats are real Bitcoin with monetary value that you earn and own immediately. mats are loyalty points that unlock ecosystem features and opportunities. You earn both simultaneously, but they don't convert to each other—sats build your Bitcoin wealth while mats unlock benefits.
