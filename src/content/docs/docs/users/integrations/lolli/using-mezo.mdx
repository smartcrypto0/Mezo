# How to Earn, Spend, & Save on Mezo

## Option 1: Just HODL (The Simplest Choice)

Your sats sit in your wallet under your complete control.

## Option 2: Borrow Against Your Bitcoin

Access dollars without selling your BTC. Keep your Bitcoin exposure while getting liquidity.

:::note[Key details]
- Fixed interest rates starting at 1% APR
- No repayment deadline—close when you want
- No credit checks, everything onchain
- Minimum $2,000 MUSD borrow amount
- You must maintain at least 110% collateralization (to borrow $1,000 MUSD, you need $1,100 worth of BTC)
:::

### How to Borrow:

<Steps>
1. Go to mezo.org/borrow and connect your wallet

2. Enter desired loan amount in MUSD

3. Review your loan terms:
   * Interest rate (currently 1% fixed)
   * Collateralization ratio
   * Liquidation price
   * Fees: 0.5% issuance fee + $200 gas deposit (returned when closed)

4. Click "Borrow" and confirm transaction

5. MUSD appears in your wallet—your BTC is locked as collateral
</Steps>

**What you can do with MUSD:**

* Spend it via Bitrefill in Mezo Market
* Swap it for other assets
* Use it in DeFi protocols

### Managing Your Loan:

Monitor your collateral ratio at mezo.org/borrow. If BTC price drops, your ratio decreases—keep it above 110% to avoid liquidation. To close your loan, return to mezo.org/borrow, click "Repay," repay the full MUSD amount plus accumulated interest, and confirm. Your BTC collateral and $200 gas deposit are returned.
