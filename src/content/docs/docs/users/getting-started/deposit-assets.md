You can deposit native Bitcoin or supported ERC-20 tokens (Bitcoin wrappers) to Mezo Mainnet. 

## Before you begin

- Check which assets are supported. You can confirm the token addresses for these addresses on the [Contracts Reference](/docs/users/resources/contracts-reference#mainnet-asset-token-contracts) page.
- All transactions on Mezo Mainnet are paid using native BTC or tBTC deposits. Before using the network, it's recommended to fund your account with BTC or tBTC to ensure you have gas to pay for transactions.

## Deposit your assets

1. Go to the [Mezo App](https://mezo.org/overview) and sign in with a supported wallet.
1. After you sign in and sign the transaction, click **Deposit Bitcoin**.
1. Select the asset you want to bridge and specify the amount.

After the transaction is complete, the bridging process begins. The process can take several minutes to complete before you receive your assets on Mainnet.
